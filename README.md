# necklaceProblem
The Necklace Problem is a number theory problem.  It begins with two single one digit numbers. The next number in the sequence is the ones digit  from the sum of the two original numbers (i.e. 7+8 = 15, therefore the next number is 5). This  process is repeated, using the last two numbers which then are summed and the oneâ€™s value of  the sum is kept as the next digit.
